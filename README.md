# React Router Dom v6.4 Demo

This project is a demonstration of how to use React Router Dom in itÂ´s version 6.4. In this project, I've created a simple website with a Navbar that has three sections: "Home," "About," and "Blog." I've also implemented loaders and error handling in routes to enhance the user experience.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding. If you don't have them, you can download and install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/beckman924/react-router-dom-6.4.git>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-router-dom-6.4
```

3. Install the project's dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you've cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can start the project as follows:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the application in development mode using Vite and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:5173.

## Features

- **Navbar:** The site features a Navbar with three sections: "Home," "About," and "Blog." You can click on these sections to navigate through the site.

- **React Router Dom:** I've used React Router Dom to handle navigation between different routes in the application.

- **Loaders:** I've implemented loaders on routes to provide a visual indication that the page is loading.

- **Route Error Handling:** If you attempt to access a non-existent route, an error page will be displayed.

## Project Structure

- **src/:** Contains the main components and routes of the application.
- **public/:** Contains static files, such as images and the favicon.
